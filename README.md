# Serial Port Tester
Client(Transmitter) side of a serial port tester. 

This script can be used to test half-duplex bridge ICs (mainly used in safety-critical applications) 
Essentially by adjusting the baud rate on the script you can test if you isolated transceiver can keep up with the baud rate.
